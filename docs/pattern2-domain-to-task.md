# Domain-to-Task Translation Pattern

**Intent:**
Enable non-technical domain experts to directly contribute to software creation by abstracting their knowledge into actionable AI tasks.

**Applicability:**
Use this pattern when domain-specific expertise must drive software development but the contributor lacks coding knowledge.

**Structure:**
1. Extract key domain concepts.
2. Frame them as tasks the AI can execute.
3. Review and iterate on outputs with the expertâ€™s guidance.

**Participants:**
- Domain Expert: Provides subject matter expertise.
- AI Agent: Translates concepts into actionable development.
- Reviewer (optional): Verifies alignment with domain intent.

**Consequences:**
- **Benefits:** Brings diverse expertise into the development process.
- **Challenges:** Requires domain experts to adapt to new workflows.
