# Multi-Agent Collaboration Pattern

**Intent:**
Coordinate multiple AI agents to work collaboratively on complex projects.

**Applicability:**
Use this pattern when a project involves tasks that can be distributed across specialized agents.

**Structure:**
1. Define roles and responsibilities for each agent.
2. Create communication protocols to ensure coordination.
3. Monitor and resolve conflicts or overlaps in outputs.

**Participants:**
- Orchestrator: Defines roles and monitors progress.
- AI Agents: Execute tasks collaboratively.
- Reviewer (optional): Ensures cohesive outputs.

**Consequences:**
- **Benefits:** Scales productivity by leveraging specialization.
- **Challenges:** Increases complexity of coordination.
