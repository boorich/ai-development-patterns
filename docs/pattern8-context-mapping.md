  # Context Mapping Pattern
  
  **Intent:**
  Ensure seamless alignment between human conversational context and code context to avoid miscommunication and errors during development.
  
  **Applicability:**
  Use this pattern whenever human goals or high-level requirements need to be translated into precise, actionable code while maintaining clarity and accuracy.
  
  **Structure:**
  1. Use a shared vocabulary between humans and AI to define requirements.
  2. Map human intent to specific code constructs using templates or predefined rules.
  3. Continuously validate the mapping with test cases and human review.
  
  **Participants:**
  - Product Owner or Domain Expert: Provides high-level requirements and context.
  - AI Agent: Translates the context into actionable code or development tasks.
  - Developer or Reviewer: Validates the mapping for correctness and clarity.
  
  **Consequences:**
  - **Benefits:** Reduces miscommunication, ensures human intent is preserved in code, and minimizes errors.
  - **Challenges:** Requires robust templates or tools to handle ambiguity and maintain traceability.
