# Prompt Engineering Pattern

**Intent:**
Enable precise and effective communication with AI agents to ensure alignment between human goals and AI execution.

**Applicability:**
Use this pattern whenever humans need to define objectives, tasks, or refinements for AI agents during software development.

**Structure:**
1. Clearly state the high-level goal.
2. Define constraints and key considerations.
3. Use iterative feedback to refine.

**Participants:**
- Human (Product Manager, Developer, Domain Expert, etc.): Provides objectives and evaluates results.
- AI Agent: Executes tasks based on instructions.

**Consequences:**
- **Benefits:** Ensures AI produces relevant, high-quality outputs aligned with human intent.
- **Challenges:** Requires humans to develop strong skills in crafting effective prompts.
