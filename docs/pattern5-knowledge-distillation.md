# Knowledge Distillation Pattern

**Intent:**
Use AI to distill large volumes of technical or domain-specific information into actionable insights.

**Applicability:**
Use this pattern when humans need to rapidly understand complex systems or make informed decisions.

**Structure:**
1. Feed source materials to the AI (e.g., documentation, datasets).
2. Request summaries, visualizations, or actionable outputs.
3. Validate and iterate based on human review.

**Participants:**
- Human Decision-Maker: Consumes distilled insights.
- AI Agent: Processes and presents information.

**Consequences:**
- **Benefits:** Accelerates decision-making and learning.
- **Challenges:** Requires robust validation to avoid misinterpretation.
