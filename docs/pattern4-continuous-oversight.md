# Continuous Oversight Pattern

**Intent:**
Ensure that AI-generated outputs align with ethical standards, business objectives, and user needs.

**Applicability:**
Use this pattern whenever AI operates autonomously or semi-autonomously in decision-making or creation.

**Structure:**
1. Define checkpoints and criteria for oversight.
2. Use human-in-the-loop reviews at critical stages.
3. Maintain a feedback loop to improve agent performance.

**Participants:**
- Human Reviewer: Evaluates outputs.
- AI Agent: Produces outputs and integrates feedback.

**Consequences:**
- **Benefits:** Prevents misalignment or unethical outcomes.
- **Challenges:** Slows down workflows if oversight is too frequent.
